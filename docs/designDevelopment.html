								<h2>User Needs</h2>
								<p>In the last phase we identified a list of user needs.</p>
								We feel that our current prototype supports the following:
									<ul>
										<li>Have a quick and easy way to categorize things</li>
										<li>Must have the right balance of general vs. specific</li>
										<li>Not hamper the professional movers. They have a system, needs and preset systems too</li>
										<li>Work offline</li>
										<li>Organizing. Helping those moving think through the most important items that they need to keep track of and will need on the other end. This includes both items critical to everyday existence and items that items that make a day feel like home.</li>
									</ul>
									Our prototype does not easily support:
									<ul>
										<li>Accessible to multiple people. </li>
										<li>Integratable with printing on paper, pdf’s</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Additionally our solution does not include a mindfulness aspect. We chose not to tackle this as our app interaction is quite nuanced and adding a reflection portion would be feature creep. </p>
								<h2>Scenarios</h2>
								<p>Shane “thinks hard” about what stuff he will need and when he will need it over the various stages of his move. His hashtags help with that. He uses: “Interim Travel”, “Montana visit”, “Need immediately in new apartment” instead of “Bed”, “Living” etc. This helps him have what he needs when he needs it, but the simple photo to box interaction doesn’t take up too much time while packing.</p>
								<p>Most of the time Rachel is packing objects located near each other, an action well-supported by our app. At the last stages she locates objects to fit in remaining boxes. She takes a picture of the object as she places it in a box and quickly adds any relevant hashtags. </p>
								<h2>Alternative Designs</h2>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/matrix.JPG" alt="" /></span>Leading up to the choice of our current design, our group reflected on insights that we had gained throughout the process of interviewing our potential users. We ultimately had 4 designs that made it to the final design discussion. The first of these was “Check your stuff out!” In this app design, users would need to choose what room items in their box belonged to and would be given a list of potential items that might be in that room based on a library housed in the app. Users would also have the ability to add more items and tap a certain number of times to add a specific quantity of items (e.g. 4 pillows from the bedroom). The second design was “Panorama and More,” which is described in detail above. The third was “Stick it!” which involved users taking pictures and/or listing each of their objects as they went into a certain box before labelling that box with a QR code that could be read by the app. This would be a functionality that we would have expected to be used by movers as well. Finally, we had “Speak it!” which made use of Siri or some other AI on the phone to keep track of what items were going in what box as the user packed them (for example, “Put toothpaste, toilet paper, and bath towel in box 4”).
								</p>
								<p>During our conversations with users, we determined a list of features and elements of the final app that would be important and created a design matrix that weighed these appropriately. Everything got a score of 1-5 in each category of the design matrix where a 5 best suited the users needs. The category that got the lowest weighting was offline. This meant that we thought it was worth considering whether the app had the ability to function when users did not have an internet connection, but we determined that was not extremely important as most phones have this capability. On the next weighting tier, we had multiplayer (multiple users could interact with the same account, i.e. if users had family/friends helping) and integratable (i.e. the app could either be used by movers or could produce a helpful printable). All of the users we talked to had outside help in some capacity, but 3 of the 5 were ultimately responsible for deciding how boxes were organized. Additionally, each of the users had varied levels of interaction with movers. Therefore, it made sense that these should be slightly more important, but not by much. On the next tier, we identified mindfulness as a potential feature of the apps. This meant that the process of using the app helped users think through their move with respect to what items to get rid of, how to pack items, etc. This was important to all of our users in some capacity; Ted and Amanda regretted not getting rid of more junk, Rachel kept very good track of what was in all of her boxes, Shane needed to know what objects he would need for a trip pre-move in and what was safe to put in storage, and Eliot needed a way for his parents to communicate what made it into what box when they did his packing for him. Finally, on our highest tier, we considered the amount of mental bandwidth it took to master the app to use it, how quick it was to use, and the ease with which one could add items to boxes.
